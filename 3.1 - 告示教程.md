## Essentials Signs

## Essentials Signs

**** You can enable each sign individually in the [Essentials
config.yml][].  
**** You need to have at least one sign type enabled to [use coloured
signs][], and don't forget about the permission nodes for colours!

**:** These special sign types come by default with the
[Essentials.jar][] plugin.

**The permission nodes to be able to create and use Essentials' signs
can be found in the [Command Reference/Perm][]. It's highly recommended
that players be granted access to use signs, while certain creation
privileges should be tightly controlled.**

## Essentials Eco Signs

These sign types are crucial to any server's economy. Players can sell
their hard-earned blocks for money with trade signs, while buy & sell
signs enable a permanent, and infinite selling/buying shop. To help your
players, you may consider creating an (infinite stock) buy sign for
netherrack(netherstone), glowstone, diamond, or other rare items.

The creation of buy & sell signs are traditionally limited to
administrators or moderators, because these are infinite shops. Trade
signs require the creator to have the items being sold, while buy & sell
signs don't.

## Coloured Signs

You can also make signs contain coloured text, using Essentials. To make
one, simply use the colour codes [here][use coloured signs] before your
text.  
For example: &4This is red
